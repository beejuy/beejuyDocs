## API conventions
We strive to make it as easy as possible to retrieve offer data from Beejuy and get you up and running in no time.

Here are some rule of thumb items to follow when working with Beejuy's API

> + 'Client' refers to the system attempting to communicate with Beejuy's API
> + All requests and responses are in JSON format
> + Every request will be authenticated
> + We use Basic authentication using base64 encode of your APIKEY and your SECRETKEY
> + You can have multiple APIKEYs in order to manage multiple applications
> + Your APIKEY and SECRETKEY are only available from your user's dashboard
